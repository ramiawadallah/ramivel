<h1 align="center">Ramivel</h1>

This package is just create admin side (multi auth), which is totaly isolated from your normal auth ( which we create using php artisan make:auth )

On top of that, you can use multiple authentication types, simultaneously, so you can be logged
in as a user and an admin, without conflicts!
